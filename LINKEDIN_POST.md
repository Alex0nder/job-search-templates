# LinkedIn Post for Job Search Templates

## Post Text (Recommended)

Tired of spending hours formatting job application documents?

I built 17 professional PDF templates in scientific publication style—clean, consistent, and ready to customize.

**The problem I'm solving:**
- Creating professional documents takes too much time
- Maintaining consistent formatting across different documents is tedious
- Most templates look generic and don't reflect your professional brand
- You need multiple document types but creating each from scratch is inefficient

**Who this helps:**
- Product designers, developers, and tech professionals who value clean, professional presentation
- Job seekers who want polished documents without spending hours on formatting
- Anyone applying to multiple positions who needs to customize quickly

**What's included:**
✅ Cover Letter  
✅ CV/Resume  
✅ Thank You Letter (post-interview)  
✅ Salary Negotiation  
✅ Rejection Response  
✅ Recommendation Request  
✅ And 11 more templates for every stage of your job search

All templates use Times New Roman, justified text, and professional margins—the same style used in scientific publications. No bullet points, no clutter, just clean, readable documents that make you stand out.

**How to use:**
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Alex0nder/job-search-templates.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit any template with your information
4. Run: `python generate_cover_letter.py` (or any template)
5. Get your PDF instantly

The best part? It's open source and free to use. Customize with your own data, generate PDFs instantly, and focus on what matters: your content, not your formatting.
